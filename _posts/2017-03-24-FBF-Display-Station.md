*In my Flashback Friday series I'm going to sift through my memory for some wins. Who knows what I'll find in there?!*

Way back in the year 2014 I had the privilege of working on probably one of the most ambitious projects (at least as far as "organic" projects go - meaning no contractor involvement) I've ever encountered in my fifteen years of civil service - replacing the I/O terminal for one of those ancient electronics test stations that were once my bread and butter. Here's an idea of what it looked like (not the actual test station I'm referring to, but close enough):

*What's up, man?*

And the I/O terminal... the inimitable Hewlett-Packard 2645A:

A real sight for sore eyes. Did I mention that this was *2014*?! All of the other test stations I'd used up to this point were either replaced entirely with something modern, in the process of being replaced, or at least had their woeful CRT I/O terminals replaced with an LCD monitor and something that runs a semi-modern operating system. For whatever reason (mostly security concerns, I'd imagine) this one had to wait until it became absolutely necessary.

The project had actually started long before I moved to this particular organization, and a contractor had already failed to produce a working replacement. So the program manager took a chance on a scrappy team of civilian engineers... and hit pay dirt. By the time I came up to speed there was little left to do
