Project number two in the can! (I realize now that that sentence might sound like toilet humor, but I swear it was unintentional.)

I'm truckin' right along in my Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer nanodegree program, as my personal mentor is well aware from our weekly check-ins. I feel bad for the guy because I honestly haven't had much need for him. I'm glad he's there, of course! But I guess the course content keeps everything pretty crystal clear, and the help from the community at large is a big heads-up to whatever obstacles might be coming my way (one benefit of being placed into a cohort that started later than others). It's good to know that Udacity has gone to great lengths to make sure I don't get stuck.

That's not to say that this thing is a cake walk by any means! I consider myself lucky that I really, truly enjoy it - that I'm *eager* to spend all of my me-time with my laptop open training a neural network. Otherwise, I think it would be easy to fall behind. Udacity estimated that students would need to devote ten hours a week to the curriculum, and it's hard to guage since I'm currently a week or two ahead of schedule and I'm sure it depends on your skill level coming in, but I'd be inclined to bump that number up at least fifty percent. We'll just have to see how the rest of the term goes, though. For now...
