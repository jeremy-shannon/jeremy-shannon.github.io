*This post belongs to a series I'm calling Self-Driving Commentary, in which I spout and ramble on whatever is rattling around in my head pertaining to self-driving cars. Enjoy!*

![Ford's City of Tomorrow](https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2017/01/09/what-if-city-moved.jpg)

A few weeks ago, CEO Mark Fields posted Ford's "[Vision for the City of Tomorrow](https://medium.com/@markfields/fords-vision-for-the-city-of-tomorrow-f096e8097595#.alscsqhw1)," and while I'm skeptical of any vision for the future that wasn't included in the [Carousel of Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney's_Carousel_of_Progress), I'm impressed. Maybe I'm a sucker for any half-baked (or better) utopia, which Ford is definitely selling here. Like [so](http://www.diseno-art.com/encyclopedia/concept_cars/ford_synus.html) [many](https://www.allcarindex.com/auto-car-model/United-States-Ford-Levacar-Mach-I-Levicar/) [concept](http://oldconceptcars.com/1930-2004/ford-gyron-concept-car-1961/) [cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_021C), though, of course I'm taking it with a grain of salt and hoping for even a semblance to materialize. 

But Ford has already made some unorthodox moves (for a Big Three), acquiring [Chariot](https://www.chariot.com/) - a "crowd-sourced shuttle service" - and partnering with [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/) - a bicycle sharing service - in the Bay Area. They might just be putting their money where their mouth is, and if Ford is serious about making this vision a reality, well... Ford just moved up a few spots on my list of companies I'd most like to work for.
