*This post belongs to a series I'm calling Self-Driving Commentary, in which I spout and ramble on whatever is rattling around in my head pertaining to self-driving cars. Enjoy!*

I know I keep going on and on about [Autonocast](http://www.autonocast.com), but c'mon - it's just *that* great. The latest episode is my favorite yet, and not just because of [Damon Lavrinc's](http://jeremyshannon.com/2017-08-18/SDCommentary-this-that.html) and [Alex Roy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Roy) glaring absence (I kid, guys - miss ya tons!), but because it was by far the most consistently technical Autonocast episode so far (with the possible exception of [Josh Hartung of Polysync's](https://twitter.com/joshuahartung?lang=en) episode). 

[Ed](https://twitter.com/Tweetermeyer) was, sadly I must say, piloting the show solo this time. Thankfully, though, he was graciously joined by the amazing [Warren Ahner](https://twitter.com/dackboor?lang=en) and [Jon Mullen](https://twitter.com/scrapple5auce) (love the Twitter handles, by the way) of [RightHook](https://www.righthook.io/) to discuss "why simulated worlds and simulated vehicles are suddenly getting so much attention." I don't know if it was coincidence that this episode came so soon after the (also amazing) [Atlantic article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/inside-waymos-secret-testing-and-simulation-facilities/537648/) all about how Waymo trains their self-driving cars with a combination of real-world testing, closed test facilities, and simulation, and which they discuss at length in the episode, but the timing couldn't have been better. 

RightHook has been on my mythical *list* for some time now. I don't recall how, exactly, I came to know of them, but they are leaders in simulation for autonomous vehicles (and not just cars, either - they even simulate most of the sensor hardware). It's a space of the industry that I'm coming to appreciate more and more as I make my way through the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/drive) and I'm certainly seeing the appeal of having a product that not only has huge potential to advance the industry as a whole, but also can generate revenue out of the gate instead of being a massive loss-leader with hopes of a likewise massive payoff.

Speaking of the Nanodegree - I just got started on the *FINAL PROJECT* and it promises to be one hell of a ride (get it?). I'm on a team with five other students, all of whom seem to be very talented engineers from what I've learned thus far. I can't wait to tell you more about it... when the time comes.

Anyway, go [listen to the episode](www.autonocast.com/blog/2017/9/2/22-why-simulation-matters-to-autonomy), already!
