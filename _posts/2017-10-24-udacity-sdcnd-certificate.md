Let all doubt be put to rest! (I'm onto you, doubters!) I have completed the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/drive) Program, to which this marvelous certificate can attest! (Add it to the pile, I guess.) 

I think we can all agree, though, that it's not about the certificate itself, but what it represents: setting a goal, working hard, sticking to it against the odds, and coming out the other end a more capable and confident human being. I proved to myself that I can still do hard things; I weathered the storm. But that doesn't mean it's time to seek safe harbor - not when there are still so many hard things that need to be done.

I'll be back soon to tell you all about the capstone project, and to reflect on the Nanodegree as a whole. Until then!
