I decided today I'm going to take a little tangent away from the self-driving car thing and talk about mid-life crises. Maybe this topic ventures a little too far into the realm of the personal, but it's what I feel like writing about at the moment.

And maybe "mid-life crisis" isn't particularly apt, seeing as I'm not *quite* mid-life (I hope). And, aside from my career, I'm actually quite happy with my life. So maybe I should call it a "mid-career crisis". When I think of a mid-life crisis I think sports cars, divorce, reinventing oneself - pretty much Kevin Spacey's character in American Beauty. That's not what this is.

My career began in the middle of a divorce: I was about to finish my bachelor's degree, but I was too preoccupied with personal matters to get on the ball with the university career services program. By the time I signed up there were only two employers bidding for hires, and I ended up getting a job at Tinker Air Force Base. 

Now, don't get me wrong. I have a lot of nice things to say about working for the federal government, and even the Air Force (have I mentioned the free* master's degree?). But I've come to realize, fifteen years later, that maybe it's not for me. It's cushy as hell, and if that's your thing then it's a great place to work. Maybe if I had gotten a rewarding, challenging job right out of school a cushy job would be a welcome change at this point. It would certainly be an easier transition to make, at least in terms of getting hired. Going the other way, I've found it's not as easy as I thought it would be.

When I started at Tinker, my job was merely a means to an end. In the absence of a rewarding career, I decided to focus my energy toward the bands I played drums in hoping to one day "make it" (though I never quite defined what that meant, or what it would mean for my career at Tinker). But the bands fizzled and faded, as they tend to do, and I was left with my old, dull government job. 

That's when I made it my goal to get into Tinker's competitive free* master's degree program. After a couple of tries, I was accepted. Loved it. Rocked it. Got my master's degree. Aaaaand I was back to the government job again. It wasn't long after returning, staring down the next twenty years of my life, that I resolved it just wasn't for me. I'm too good for this - going back to school gave me the confidence to say so. I owed the govenment three years for the master's degree, but I wasn't sure if I could even make it that long (spoiler alert: that three years is up in one month, and I'm still here).

I uncovered a passion for software around this time. Not the antiquated, highly specialized automated testing software that gets stored on nine-track, reel-to-reel magnetic tape and takes a full day to compile. I'd had enough of that. I'm talking about apps! I managed to get myself transferred to an organization on base that does application software for some time, but I was still looking for private sector work. The few connections I'd tapped seemed promising, but ultimately passed. The recruiters didn't get me a single interview. 

What happened? I thought that my master's degree in electrical and computer engineering would give me a major leg up trying to find work as a software developer. But I probably overestimated the demand in the job market. It's not an industry that requires a college degree, and I'm probably a hard sell when an employer can hire someone without a college degree (yet with a comparable amount of experience) at roughly half what I currently make. And I hadn't hit the job market in fifteen years. Still, after a few months of really trying, and failing, I needed to regroup.

I considered maybe quitting Tinker at the end of the three-year contract and going to a coding bootcamp. I don't necessarily think I have a lot to learn from a bootcamp, but it would be a good opportunity to put together a portfolio and make some connections. I could rock the ever-loving shit out of it, impress my teachers, and get some awesome references and testimonials out of it. That was kind of the plan, until the self-driving car thing came along.

I think machine learning and artificial intelligence, even though it's tougher to pick up than application software, is a better avenue for me because I *can* pick it up. I just can't imagine many programmers with a non-technical background that aren't scared off by the level of math involved. And nor can I imagine that a master's in electrical and computer engineering is frowned upon in the field.

So... this is my new path. Crisis averted!
