![Alt Text][im01]

I kind of can't believe I've already finished Term 1 of the Nanodegree. It feels like it flew by, but also like it's been my whole life. I think I prepared myself more than I realized at the time when I took Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, and Deep Learning courses - as well as the first few units of Intro to Computer Vision - in the weeks leading up to the start of my cohort. I just kept that pace in the Nanodegree and it served me well - I finished all of the projects on time (or even a week or two early), completed or made a good attempt at each project's extra challenge, blogged every step of the way, researched and compiled a list of companies (I'm up to 133!) in or around the self-driving car industry, kept abreast of autonomous vehicle news, listened to AI and ML podcasts, and helped out several my fellow students. 

It's been a hell of a ride so far, and I'm already working on Term 2 thanks to Udacity allowing us December students who finished early to start Term 2 with the November cohort. I joined a team doing [the Udacity Didi Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/didi-challenge), and I'm still blogging (I promise!) and consuming all the AV/ML/AI/DL/what-have-ya news. I get the feeling that when Term 3 ends I won't know what to do with myself!
