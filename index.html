    Hi there! My name is <span class="my-name">Jeremy Shannon</span> and I'm learning to become a self-driving car engineer. I have a master's degree in electrical and computer engineering, and fifteen years of experience working as an electronics engineer and software developer.<br>

  <em><span class="white-text">I hope to make a career for myself in the self-driving car industry.</span> On my first visit to New York City I became enthralled with public transit and how instrumental a comprehensive transit system can be as a public service. While I’m compelled by the relief to congestion and other benefits self-driving cars promise for such dense cities, I find the potential benefits to extremely low density cities like my home of Oklahoma City, where car ownership is all but a necessity, equally compelling. The poor and handicapped are forced to depend on an inefficient and unreliable transit system, and the sprawl renders a comprehensive system cost prohibitive. That’s where, in my imagination, self-driving cars come in.</em>
