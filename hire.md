...please! :)

I am open to opportunities in the autonomous vehicle industry, particularly those in the mobility-as-a-service sector. Path planning, navigation, and optimization, as well as ride sharing and user experience, all appeal to my creative side, while localization, computer vision, sensor fusion, and other lower-level functions probably play more to my strengths. Whatever the need, I would be thrilled just to take part in advancing the technology. I'm prepared to relocate within the United States, and possibly overseas.
