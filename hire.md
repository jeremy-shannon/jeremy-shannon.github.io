...please! :)

Seriously, though - I am open to any opportunities in the autonomous vehicle industry.

I'm particularly interested in the mobility-as-a-service sector. Path planning, navigation, and optimization, as well as ride sharing and user experience: all of these appeal to my more creative side and my customer focus. On the other hand, localization, computer vision, sensor fusion, and other lower-level functions probably play more to my strengths. Whatever the need, I would be thrilled just to take part in advancing the technology. I'm prepared to relocate within the United States, and possibly overseas. Please don't hesitate to get in touch - if you have a need, I'd love to talk!
