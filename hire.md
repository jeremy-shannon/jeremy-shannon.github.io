I am looking for opportunities in the autonomous vehicle industry.

I'm eager to contribute to the next revolution in mobility and what might be the most profoundly impactful technological advancement since the Internet: self-driving cars. With 13 years of experience in software development and maintenance and 10 years in automated electronics testing, as well as team leadership and project/program management experience, and demonstrable communication skills, I have much to offer and embrace the challenge in pivoting my career toward artificial intelligence and robotics. I feel that my passion and curiosity for self-driving cars and machine learning, not to mention my background in electronics and pending Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity, make me eminently qualified for a career in autonomous vehicles.

I'm particularly interested in the mobility-as-a-service sector. Path planning, navigation, and optimization, even ride sharing and user experience: all of these appeal to my more creative side and my strong customer focus. On the other hand, localization, computer vision, sensor fusion, and other lower-level functions probably play more to my strengths and background. Whatever the need, I would be thrilled just to take part in advancing the technology. I'm prepared to relocate within the United States, and possibly overseas. Please don't hesitate to get in touch - if you have a need, I'd love to talk!
