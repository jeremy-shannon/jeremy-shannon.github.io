I am looking for opportunities in the autonomous vehicle industry.

I'm eager to contribute to the next revolution in mobility and what might be the most profoundly impactful technological advancement since the Internet: self-driving cars. With 13 years of experience in software development and maintenance and 10 years in automated electronics testing, as well as team leadership and project/program management experience, and demonstrable organizational and communication skills, I have much to offer and embrace the challenge in pivoting my career away from aerospace and toward state-of-the-art in automotive technology. I feel that my passion and curiosity for, specifically, self-driving cars and, more braodly, robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, not to mention my background in electronics and Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity, make me eminently qualified for a career in autonomous vehicles.

I'm particularly interested in the mobility-as-a-service sector, and feel strongly that autonomy will bring about an automobile ownership model more akin to that of aircraft and watercraft we already know today. I am skilled in the areas of perception (through several projects harnessing the power of computer vision and machine learning on dash cam images and one project processing and interpreting real-world LiDAR point cloud data), sensor fusion (through a number of projects implementing extended and unscented kalman filters and particle filters), classic and modern control theory (through PID control and model predictive control projects), and path/motion planning. There isn't a sector of the robotics technology stack that doesn't appeal to me and each plays to my strengths and background in engineering and academics. Whatever your need, I would be thrilled just to take part in advancing the technology. I'm prepared to relocate within the United States, and possibly overseas. Please don't hesitate to get in touch - if you have a need, I'd love to talk!
