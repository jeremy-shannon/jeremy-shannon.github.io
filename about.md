<<<<<<< HEAD
Sure, you can call me a late bloomer if it makes you feel better, but there have certainly been *later* bloomers. You wouldn't be incorrect, though - it took me half of a career to find my passion. 
Now, that's not to say I didn't have goals up to this point. In my twenties I thought I might one day play drums in a famous rock band (hell, semi-famous would have sufficed), and what most might consider a career was just a way to bankroll it. Somehow turning thirty made the idea of spending my days cooped up in a van eating Funyons a *little* less appealing

I'll get to this soon......
