### The story so far...

Sure, you can call me a late bloomer (if it makes you feel better), but there have certainly been *later* bloomers who've gone on to accomplish great things. You wouldn't be incorrect, though - it took me almost half of a career to find my true calling.

Now, that's not to say I didn't have goals up to this point. In my twenties I thought I might one day play drums in a famous rock band (hell, semi-famous would have sufficed), and a stable career with the Air Force as an electronics engineer was a great way to bankroll it. When I turned thirty, though, I guess a switch in my brain was flipped and suddenly the idea of spending my days mostly cooped up in a van eating truck stop cuisine with a number of other individuals, each with his or her own idea of what denotes an acceptable level of personal hygeine, became just a *little* unappealing.

I needed something new to focus my energy on, so I went back to school to get a master's degree - partly because my employer generously offered to pay for it, but mostly because I needed the challenge - a chance to prove to myself that I could still do hard things. And I rocked it. I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, a [kickass robot](http://jeremyshannon.com/2016/05/20/sumo-duel-bot.html), and a [conference paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6935147/?reload=true) to my name. 

It was while working on my thesis that I discovered my affinity for software development. Software wasn't new to me, by any means, but modern languages and tools were. The creativity and immediacy of it thrilled me, and I thoroughly enjoyed coding applications for a few years while fulfilling a service contract for the master's degree. 

I've now put fifteen years in with the federal goverment, and I can't help but feel that there must be something *more* for me out there. I found myself wondering aloud how possible it would be to break into the autonomous vehicle industry - working on the bleeding edge of technology with a brilliant team just as excited as I am about ushering in the next great revolution in mobility. Right about that time Udacity announced its [Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/drive).

And that's where this blog begins...
